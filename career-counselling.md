## Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation:**  
As part of the Work Readiness Training, I attended a career counselling session to help define my professional goals.

**Task:**  
I needed to explore career paths that align with my strengths and interests, and create a realistic plan.

**Action:**  
I completed a career planning worksheet and met with a career advisor who helped guide me through my options and set short- and long-term goals.

**Result:**  
I gained clarity on my career direction. I now have a solid goal of becoming a software developer and understand what academic and professional steps I need to take.
